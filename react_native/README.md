Trainér is the dating app for Pokemon enthusiasts! Discover and connect with Pokemon in your area. Save your favorite Pokemon by viewing their profiles. With Trainér, you'll never have to catch 'em all alone again!

## Build and run Trainér

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed
the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
